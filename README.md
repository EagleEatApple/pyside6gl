# PySide6GL

Professor Lee Stemkoski published a very good book - Developing Graphics Frameworks with Python and OpenGL.
However, the original code were using Pygame, now I'm trying to port all of the code to PySide6.

If you enjoy the code, please give my repo a star ⭐ ⬆️. 

## Requirements
* PySide6
* PyOpenGL
